# Sequence testing for the striatum
We are testing pulse sequences at our new imaging center (Temple University Brain Imaging Center; TUBRIC) and we are attempting to optimize signal in the striatum. We are using 3T Siemens Prisma with a 64-channel head coil. We've sought some initial advice from the [NeuroStars mailing list][1] and also [Twitter][2].

This repo currently contains two folders. The BIDS folder contains code for converting the data to BIDS format and running relevant BIDS apps. The psychtoolbox folder contains code for the tasks we ran (finger tapping, reward learning, and monetary incentive delay).

All results and observations will be posted to OSF and linked to this GitHub repo.
